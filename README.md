# DiceRoller
## A simple windows app to roll Roleplaying dices.

Prety self explanatory the seed field it's meant to be there for repeatibility, leave empty to use a random one.


To use it just grab the exe from the releases tab and run.
If you want to build yourself, clone repo and open it on Visual Studio.

-----------

* Limited to 1000 dices at once
* D10 and D100 are missing because we don't use them

-----------

If you want D10 and D100 added or some other feature (or some king of stats on the rolls) just let me know.
